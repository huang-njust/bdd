# bddschedule

This program is to search a scheduling path from the initial state to a given goal marking of a P-timed Petri net of RASs by using BDD techniques. 
Before running it, create a file of incidence matrix (netname_matrix.txt) and a file containing an initial marking, operation times and a goal marking (netname_init.txt) in the same folder as the source file (BDDScheduling.cxx).

Running environment: Buddy-2.2

# bddschedule

This program is to search a scheduling path from an initial state to a given goal marking of a place-timed Petri net of RASs by using binary decision diagram techniques. 
Before running it, create a file of incidence matrix (netname_matrix.txt) and a file containing an initial marking, operation times of places and a goal marking (netname_init.txt) in the same folder as the source file of BDDScheduling.cxx.

Running environment: Centos + Buddy-2.2
